  <h2>Understanding inter- and intra-city differences</h2>
  <p class="text-medium">
    This process was repeated for all 371 cities included in the SALURBAL
    project. The result is an unprecedented data resource that allows us to
    document and compare differences in health and wellbeing both between and
    within cities across Latin America. You can find examples of analyses using
    this data structure in our <a
      href="https://drexel.edu/lac/data-evidence/publications/"

    >.
