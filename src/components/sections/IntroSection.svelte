  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="text-medium">
    The SALURBAL team has developed a rigorous protocol for defining cities,
    sub-cities, and neighborhoods. This process allows us to study and compare
    urban environments and their health impacts across cities in 11 countries in
    Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
    Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru.

    We undertook a systematic approach to identify and define SALURBAL cities.
    The approach described below has guided the definition of geographic areas
    to which all SALURBAL data is linked. You can read more about this process
