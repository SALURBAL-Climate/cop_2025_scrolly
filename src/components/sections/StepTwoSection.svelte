  <h3>Step 2: Combining neighboring cities</h3>
  <p class="text-medium">
    Cities that were initially considered separate cities were combined into one
    city if they were part of the same agglomeration, that is, if their built-up
    areas were connected. We used the name of the city with the larger
    population to label these units. In a few cases where the populations were
    nearly equal, we assigned a hyphenated name (e.g., Valparaiso-Vi√±a del Mar,
    Chile). This process resulted in 371 cities, which we refer to as "SALURBAL
    cities."
