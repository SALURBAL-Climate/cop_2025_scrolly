# COP30 Urban Health Guide: Scrollytelling PRD

## Project Overview
**Content recycling project** to convert existing COP30 guide into interactive scrollytelling experience with minimal investment. Goal is to reach new audiences that current PDF and Instagram formats miss: **professionals who need guided, mobile-friendly learning** but want more depth than social media and more engagement than static documents. This targets the gap between formal academic resources and social content consumption.

## Content Recycling Strategy: Transforming Static to Interactive

### 1. Medium Comparison vs. PDF
**What PDF Does Well:**
- Comprehensive, authoritative reference document
- Easy to download and share officially
- Academic credibility and formal structure

**What Scrollytelling Adds:**
- Breaks down 8-page dense content into digestible chunks
- Makes complex COP processes visual and intuitive
- Transforms passive reading into active exploration
- Better mobile experience for busy professionals

### 2. Medium Comparison vs. Instagram Carousel
**What Instagram Does Well:**
- Quick social sharing and discovery
- Visual appeal and bite-sized information
- Easy consumption on mobile

**What Scrollytelling Adds:**
- Maintains narrative flow without platform limitations
- Provides deeper detail while staying engaging
- Creates permanent reference (not algorithm-dependent)
- Allows for data visualization and interactivity
