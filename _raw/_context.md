# Bringing urban health to the table at COP30: A guide for public health researchers and practitioners

*Updated: April 2025*

**How do "COPs" work? What role does public health research play? How can researchers translate health evidence to drive climate action?**

## What are COPs?

A "Conference of the Parties" (COP) refers to a meeting ("conference") of the countries, or governments, ("parties") who have signed an international agreement, convention, or treaty. "COPs" take place within the context of agreements surrounding many topics.

The **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** holds annual COPs to negotiate global actions to address climate change. The 30th annual Conference of the Parties ("COP30") will take place in November 2025, hosted by Brazil.

## What Happens at UNFCCC COPs?

### Preparatory sessions and "Pre-COPs"
COP agendas are developed during **preparatory meetings** hosted by the **COP presidency** (host country) and convene official country representatives, content experts, and other actors over the year or two prior to each Conference. **Pre-COPs** are informal meetings that traditionally take place in the month or so before each COP.

### Core negotiation
Delegates of the Parties participate in official sessions of the governing bodies, and **in open and closed negotiating meetings**. Delegates can include government officials from relevant ministries; experts and scientists; and civil society organization representatives. Sometimes, this negotiation results in a binding agreement (e.g., Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement), which must then be ratified by individual governments. More often, the Parties agree to some form of public declaration.

### "High-level COP"
This public stage, open to delegates and observers, includes speeches by heads of state, announcements of coalitions, public denunciations, or calls to action. Observers can include intergovernmental & nongovernmental organizations, United Nations and related agencies, as well as media representatives.

### "Third COP"
Additional activities include side events, pavilions, panel talks, presentations, and protests, where participants can include scientists, NGOs, private sector representatives, and activists.

### Activity Zones

**"Blue zone" activities**: Access restricted to accredited delegates only. Formal negotiations, country pavilions, and official side events take place and are managed by the UNFCCC.

**"Green zone" activities**: Open to the public, managed by the host country. Includes additional events, workshops, and exhibitions by private sector and NGO representatives.

## Where does health fit in?

Since 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) has hosted regular Global Conferences on Health and Climate Change. Historically, these events have taken place on the sidelines of the UNFCCC COPs. In recent years, the connections between climate change and health have received increased attention within the context of international negotiations during annual COPs.

### Timeline of Health Integration in COPs

**2017 COP23 - FIJI**
At the 2017 COP23 hosted by Fiji and held in Germany, WHO launched a **Special Initiative on Climate Change and Health in Small Island Developing States** (SIDS).

**2021 COP26 - GLASGOW**
The "**COP26 Special Report on Climate Change and Health**" was developed in the lead up to the 2021 COP26 in Glasgow, where WHO also hosted the first Health Pavilion.

**2023 COP28 - DUBAI**
The 2023 COP28 in Dubai also featured a **Health Pavilion**, hosted by WHO and the Wellcome Trust, as well as the first-ever **Health Day**, which culminated in the endorsement of the **Declaration on Climate and Health**. COP28 elevated the role of health in the climate change agenda and secured a global commitment to addressing climate-related health impacts.

**2024 COP29 - BAKU**
At the 2024 COP29 in Baku, delegates committed to the **Baku COP Presidencies Continuity Coalition for Climate and Health**, securing a permanent space for health within future COP agendas.

## The road to COP30: Brazil 2025

The COP presidency rotates each year on a regional basis. **COP30** is scheduled to take place in Latin America, in Belém, Brazil, from November 10-21, 2025. Health-focused plans for COP30 are constantly evolving and include the presentation of the **COP 30 Climate & Health Action Plan**, led by Brazil, which aims to strengthen health systems' resilience to climate change impacts and support countries in implementing equitable adaptation strategies. For an updated list of health-related activities and events, see: [link]

## How are national and local governments committing to climate and health?

**Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** are national climate action plans that outline each country's commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries committed to submitting an updated NDC every five years.

### Key Statistics:
- **90%**: In 2023, almost all (90%) NDCs to the Paris Agreement include health considerations.
- **1/3**: About a third identify the health co-benefits of mitigation action.
- **1/10**: Only about one in ten quantify and/or monitor these benefits.

## Appendix

### Notable Agreements

**COPs 3 and 11 (1997, 2005)**: The Kyoto Protocol was negotiated during COP3 and entered into force during COP11 in 2005, setting mitigation targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mandating regular progress reviews.

**COP21 (2015)**: COP21 resulted in the landmark Paris Agreement (195 parties), which replaced the Kyoto Protocol and seeks to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.

# COP30 Urban Health Guide: Scrollytelling PRD

## Project Overview
**Content recycling project** to convert existing COP30 guide into interactive scrollytelling experience with minimal investment. Goal is to reach new audiences that current PDF and Instagram formats miss: **professionals who need guided, mobile-friendly learning** but want more depth than social media and more engagement than static documents. This targets the gap between formal academic resources and social content consumption.

## Content Recycling Strategy: Transforming Static to Interactive

### 1. Medium Comparison vs. PDF
**What PDF Does Well:**
- Comprehensive, authoritative reference document
- Easy to download and share officially
- Academic credibility and formal structure

**What Scrollytelling Adds:**
- Breaks down 8-page dense content into digestible chunks
- Makes complex COP processes visual and intuitive
- Transforms passive reading into active exploration
- Better mobile experience for busy professionals

### 2. Medium Comparison vs. Instagram Carousel
**What Instagram Does Well:**
- Quick social sharing and discovery
- Visual appeal and bite-sized information
- Easy consumption on mobile

**What Scrollytelling Adds:**
- Maintains narrative flow without platform limitations
- Provides deeper detail while staying engaging
- Creates permanent reference (not algorithm-dependent)
- Allows for data visualization and interactivity
